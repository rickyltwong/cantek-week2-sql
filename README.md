# PostgreSQL Project with DVD Rental Database

## Introduction

This project is part of Cantek's Data Analytics program. The goal is to create a PostgreSQL database for a DVD rental company. The database is created using the DVD Rental database, which is a sample database that represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. The .tar file of the database can be downloaded from [PostgreSQL Tutorial Website](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) or from [this repo](./dvdrental.tar).

## Database Schema

The database is composed of 15 tables:
- actor: stores actors data including first name and last name.
- address: stores address data for each staff member.
- category: stores movie’s categories data.
- city: stores city names.
- country: stores country names.
- customer: stores customers data.
- film: stores films data.
- film_actor: stores the relationships between films and actors.
- film_category: stores the relationships between films and categories.
- inventory: stores inventory data.
- language: stores languages data.
- payment: stores customer’s payments data.
- rental: stores rental data.
- staff: stores staff data.
- store: contains the store data. 

The following diagram illustrates the DVD Rental database tables and their relationships with each other.
